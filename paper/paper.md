# Summary

We present PsychoPhysioCollector, a smartphone-based data collection app for psychophysiological research. The app allows high flexibility in designing and running sensor-enhanced ESM [@Larson1983] research protocols. PsychoPhysioCollector provides native support for Shimmer R2 IMUs with Shimmer ECG-Modul and Shimmer Gyro-Modul and Zephyr BioHarness 3 [@Zephyr], and its visualization component allows checking the experimental setup in real time. The sensing/computing component can be easily set up and configured to sample data in combination with self-report, allowing the researcher to correlate to physiological, kinematical and subjective variables, as well as to analyze fluctuations over time. The pilot deployment was successfully used in the research project Flow-Machines ("Flow-Machines: Body Movement and Sound", 2012-2015) at the University of Applied Sciences Bremen and funded by German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF; FÃ¶rderkennzeichen: 03FH084PX2).
